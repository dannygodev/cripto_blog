A mathematical explanation for this is given in the context of the One-Time Pad in
Sect. 2.2.2. However, it is worth having a closer look at addition modulo 2. If we do
arithmetic modulo 2, the only possible values are 0 and 1 (because if you divide by
2, the only possible remainders are 0 and 1). Thus, we can treat arithmetic modulo
2 as Boolean functions such as AND gates, OR gates, NAND gates, etc. Let’s look
at the truth table for modulo 2 addition:
This should look familiar to most readers: It is the truth table of the exclusive-OR,
also called XOR, gate. This is in important fact: Modulo 2 addition is equivalent to
